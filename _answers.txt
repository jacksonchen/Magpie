Activity 2:
  Exercises:
    When more than one word appears in a string, the Magpie program responds to the word that first appears in the list of “else if” statements in the getResponse method.
  Questions:
    1. When a keyword is included in another word, the program still acts as if it is a standalone word.  “Know” is treated as “no” and “smothered” as “mother.”
